# OCR-system-using-Python
This is an algorithm for identifying the textual characters from a photo/pdf which is constructed using python language.
I have used pytesseract library which is a free resource to use for OCR. I have also created another code to convert pdf/picture to textual characters. Can check all of them which one works for you.
For OCR 1 code, there is a sample pdf given for your reference.
Make sure that you have all the plugins and libraries installed including poppler.
